# libft

A C library that creates reimplementations of common standard functions:

* Core C functions: string, memory, and character operations

Also included funcitonality that were not in spec:

* Dynamic vector: a generic, resizable array
* `ft_printf`: a simple `printf` equivalent
* `get_next_line`: read input line by line

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uygarpolat/libft.git
cd libft
make
```

This builds `libft.a` in the project root.
